# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for deploying and configuring environments on various Linux distributions.

## Key Features
- Uses a dotfiles manager: [Dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter).
- The project includes binaries `./dotter` and `./dotter.arm`, which allow running commands without installing Dotter.
- Final files are generated using the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide) templating engine.
- Scripts are written in the [Rhai](https://github.com/rhaiscript/rhai) language.

## Documentation
- More about Dotter: [Dotter Wiki](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter/wiki).
